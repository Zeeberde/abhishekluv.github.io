<p>This year starting from July, I made some changes in the way I manage my health and day-to-day activities.</p>

<ul>
<li>Saying No to few things</li>
<li>Saying Yes to few things</li>
<li>Giving body what it needs</li>
<li>Developing a habit pattern</li>
</ul>


<p>I hope these things can be of some help for you too.</p>

<h2>Saying No to few things :</h2>

<ul>
<li>Aerated drinks</li>
<li>Milk (Milk is best taken alone, or let alone)</li>
<li>Tea</li>
<li>Coffee</li>
<li>Burgers</li>
<li>Diet Aerated drinks</li>
<li>Smoking</li>
<li>Alcohol</li>
<li>Meat</li>
<li>Any Non-veg products</li>
</ul>


<h2>Saying Yes to few things :</h2>

<ul>
<li>Water(Depends. 3litres water every day)</li>
<li>Leafy vegetables</li>
<li>Green tea</li>
<li>Dry fruits</li>
<li>Fresh fruits</li>
<li>Jaggery(better than white sugar)</li>
<li>Dates(natural sweet)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Giving body what it needs</h2>

<p>These are some of the things that I have altered in my everyday activity.</p>

<p>Our body’s need these things more than foods :</p>

<ul>
<li>Oxygen : Doing vital diaphragmatic breathing</li>
<li>Water : Having water and more liquid content</li>
<li>Aerobic exercise : Doing exercise using Aerobic power (i.e. my breath)</li>
<li>Breakfast : Starting my day with something live in the morning( Lime or any fruit juice)</li>
<li>Structural support : While sitting on a chair I try not to sit on my thighs. Instead, I sit on my sit bone. Blood and Oxygen circulation should be normal while sitting. If we hunch or sit on our thighs, then our blood and oxygen circulation will not be proper.</li>
<li>Properly combining my food</li>
</ul>


<p><em>It is not what we eat but what we digest and assimilate that adds to our health, strength and usefulness.</em></p>

<h2>Developing a habit pattern</h2>

<p>I have developed my own habit pattern which helps me to stay energetic and in balance the whole day. No backaches, No headaches, No leg numbness, No hands or wrist numbness.</p>

<ul>
<li>4:30am: Get up, having Lime juice with lukewarm water and with very little honey (You can avoid honey if required)</li>
<li>5:00am: Colon cleansing (Potty time and productivity thinking time. Potty time is very imp.)</li>
<li>5:30am to 6:30am: Exercise or 1hour Meditation (by concentrating on the breath or listening to Sanskrit mantras. With empty/half empty stomach)</li>
<li>7:00am : Breaking the fast with an Oat Meal(Oats, Dry fruits, little jaggery)</li>
<li>7:30am : Starting my work</li>
<li>10:30am : Working and Having some fresh raw vegetables/fruits like(carrots, cucumber, apples, banana or others)</li>
<li>12:00pm : Working and Having a glass of Green tea with Hot water, Lemon and very little honey</li>
<li>2:00pm : Lunch time(dal, little rice, 3 roti’s, vegetables, vegetables with high fibre content)</li>
<li>2:30pm : Back to my work</li>
<li>5:00pm : Working and Having a glass of Green tea with Hot water(No lemon or honey)</li>
<li>6:30pm to 7:30pm : 1hour Walking(<a href="#fitbit">Minimum 10,000 steps</a>. With empty/half empty stomach.)</li>
<li>8:00pm: Having one Mosambi (Orange-Navel) fruit</li>
<li>dinner before 9:00pm: Dinner time (dal, no rice, 2 roti’s, vegetables, and vegetables with high fibre content)</li>
<li>10:00pm: time for bed.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Fitbit app</h2>

<p>I use the Fitbit app with Motion Data to count the number of steps I have completed while walking.</p>

<p><em>I&rsquo;m using the Fitbit app with my Microsoft 640 XL Windows Phone</em></p>
