<h2>What is a Recipe</h2>


<p>Orchard simplifies the process of setting up a new website by letting you use website recipes. A recipe is an XML file that contains the startup configuration for an Orchard website. When you start Orchard for the first time, you can select a recipe that best matches the type of site you want to set up.</p>


<p>For example, if you want your website to be a blog, you can select the Blog recipe, and much of the configuration work will be done for you.</p>


<p>You can create your own recipes and customize the process of setting a website and configuring Orchard features. Recipes can also instruct Orchard to download and install modules and themes from the Orchard Gallery during website setup.</p>


<p>This course describes how to use recipes, how to create custom recipes, export or import recipes, how to create a website using a custom recipe.</p>
