Vairagya samrajyadha poojanabhyam, namo nama sri guru padukhabyam., 1</p>
<p>Salutations and Salutations to the sandals of my Guru,
Which is a boat, which helps me,cross the endless ocean of life,

And by worship of which, I attain the dominion of renunciation</p></blockquote>

Salutations and Salutations to the sandals of my Guru,</p>
<p>Which is the ocean of knowledge, resembling the full moon,
Which is the water, which puts out the fire of misfortunes,
And which removes distresses of those who prostrate before it.</p></blockquote>
