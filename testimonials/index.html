<p>&ldquo;Very well done step by step guidance to developing and hosting a very economical way of getting your first Web Page up and running. Narration is very precise and clear with easy to follow examples. I especially like the basic information since I was not so familiar with GitHub and bootstrap before this course.&rdquo;</p>


<blockquote><p>Bill Halford &ndash; a udemy student</p></blockquote>


<p>&ldquo;Excellent Guidance!! This course is great in explaining how to host static websites using GitHub Pages. The structure of the course has been well planned &ndash; each necessary step is presented in a clear-cut, concise manner. It also provides reasons on why we should be using GitHub Pages and Twitter Bootstrap. From the setting up of GitHub account, new repository, GitHub Pages, to the creation of a static website with Twitter Bootstrap and the setting up of domain name with GitHub Pages, I would say this course is about as comprehensive as it can get. It covers every general thing you need to know about hosting static websites using GitHub Pages. In a nutshell, if you&rsquo;re looking to learn how to host static websites using GitHub Pages, look no further. This course will help you get the job done with minimal fuss.&rdquo;</p>


<blockquote><p>Michael Lim &ndash; a udemy student</p></blockquote>


<p>&ldquo;Awesomely well designed practical course</p>


<p>Abhishek Luv has done a great job. +10 for this course. Best part is that you don&rsquo;t have to work with the command line tool its just the GUI tool with stage , commit and push with 3 clicks your site will be live.&#8221;</p>


<blockquote><p>Ram Rathod &ndash; a udemy student</p></blockquote>


<p>&ldquo;Great Course. Very Useful!! Websites hosted at GitHub Pages seems to be blazing fast. That&rsquo;s what I need. Thanks Abhishek Luv for creating such an awesome and practical course.&rdquo;</p>


<blockquote><p>Monu &ndash; a udemy student</p></blockquote>


<p>&ldquo;fantastic work&rdquo;</p>


<blockquote><p>Saad Khalaf Ahmed &ndash; a udemy student</p></blockquote>


<p>&ldquo;Great One. Abhishek presented a new course very well.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>Orchard CMS Workflows (50% Off Coupon Code)</h3>


<p><a href="https://www.udemy.com/orchard-cms-tutorial-workflows-in-orchard-cms/?couponCode=YTWorkflows">https://www.udemy.com/orchard-cms-tutorial-workflows-in-orchard-cms/?couponCode=YTWorkflows</a></p>


<p>&ldquo;Great introduction to Workflows in Orchard CMS.The demos were very well put together. Each section had a definitive goal and the screen recordings described each step with the right amount of detail. I was able to quickly navigate through the course without needing to spend a crazy amount of time with useless information or advertising of features. Everything was on point and the length of each lecture was great. The lectures, themselves, were well thought out. I would love to see this expanded to cover various other types of workflows, or just a general description of what each workflow action does and when best to use it. For example, when to use the exclusive branch vs branch option, or a good demo of using the web request action. There&rsquo;s a lot of power behind Orchard Workflows and this tutorial gives a great introduction to that feature.&rdquo;</p>


<blockquote><p>Gustavo Tandeciarz &ndash; a udemy student</p></blockquote>


<p>&ldquo;Excellent!! Really helpful. Good demonstration about workflows in orchard cms.&rdquo;</p>


<blockquote><p>Monu &ndash; a udemy student</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Arjun &ndash; a udemy student</p></blockquote>


<p>&ldquo;Absolutely Excellent Course to get started with Theme creation in Orchard CMS. The course begins with cloning the orchard source code from codeplex, installing it using VS 2013. Next it dives into the basics of theme creation in Orchard. Shapes is the heart of Orchard so most of the focus is given to shapes in this course for ex like what are shapes, overriding shapes using shape tracing. In the end the author shows how to create your theme package for Orchard CMS. The course author has tried his best to offer good content in this course. If you are new to Orchard CMS and want to get started with developing websites and custom Orchard CMS themes then this course is for you. Go get it straight away. This course saves you a lot of your steep learning curve and your time too. 60 $ for a 3.5 hours is damn worth it.&rdquo;</p>


<blockquote><p>Monu &ndash; a udemy student</p></blockquote>


<p>&ldquo;Nice course. This course really gives a jump start for creating themes in Orchard CMS.</p>


<p>Thank You Abhishek Luv&#8221;</p>

<h3>Orchard CMS Beginners Course : Testimonials</h3>


<p><a href="https://www.udemy.com/orchard-cms-for-absolute-beginners">https://www.udemy.com/orchard-cms-for-absolute-beginners</a></p>


<p>&ldquo;The name of the course says it all. It&rsquo;s a great way to &#8220;get a handle&rdquo; on some (actually) core concepts/terminology of Orchard.</p>


<p>I&rsquo;m a developer, so perhaps first instinct says &ldquo;it&rsquo;s too shallow&rdquo;, but again, the name of the course says it explicitly. As a developer you will understand what a user should understand and therefore hopefully guide your own efforts (if you end up extending, etc) to mitigate learning curve you may introduce with your work.</p>


<p>The style of teaching, short concise and to the point, is excellent. Doesn&rsquo;t waste your time, keeps you focused. It is sequenced in a way that makes you understand how each &ldquo;part&rdquo; relates to each other.</p>


<p>IMHO, it should fit your style of learning. Don&rsquo;t have &ldquo;all day&rdquo; to listen to a lecture? Fine, learn in short, quick bursts. Want to ingest it all in one sitting? Fine, go through it in one sitting.</p>


<p>If there&rsquo;s one item for improvement (and maybe I just missed it), it would be to reference &ldquo;zones&rdquo; as it relates visually to the user. It&rsquo;s actually on the screen, but the &ldquo;connection&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t mentioned so the user knows where &ldquo;content&rdquo; (zone) actually visually sits on a given layout (vs. &ldquo;footer&rdquo;, etc.).&#8221;</p>


<blockquote><p>Ed Chavez &ndash; a udemy student</p></blockquote>


<p>&ldquo;A great course for orchard beginners. The best thing about this tutorial is that each module is short and crisp. I could easily follow and start my work on orchard simultaneously. I like the division of sections and the topics.</p>


<p>I would surely recommend this course for all beginners. Thanks Abhishek for this tutorial&#8221;</p>


<blockquote><p>Yogita Sharma &ndash; a udemy student</p></blockquote>


<p>&ldquo;Orchard for the Absolute beginner Ronald Brink&rdquo; Hi Abhishek Luv, I&rsquo;m a professional .Net developer and in my spare time I develop websites using Wordpress. However as being a .Net developer I did get interested in Orchard, so I&rsquo;m only recently investigating of shifting my website development efforts from Wordpress towards Orchard. This course has given me a quick but very useful starting point for using Orchard. The very nice thing is that every lecture is quite short so it does not take too much of my time, whilst still giving me a good first time shot on Orchard. Thanks for sharing this and I hope you keep up this good work of lecturing on Orchard and relates services. Kind regards, Ronald Brink</p>


<blockquote><p>Ronald Brink &ndash; a udemy student</p></blockquote>


<p>&ldquo;First step in Orchard. This course is very helpful for everyone who want to start with this CMS system. In lectures about projection and taxonomies I would like to see better examples of using. They can help with understanding those modules and their using in practice.&rdquo;</p>


<blockquote><p>Standa Prochazka &ndash; a udemy student</p></blockquote>


<p>&ldquo;Probably the only available complete Orchard Tutorial. Tutorials are great. As the course title says, it is definitely an through overview of Orchard for the absolute beginner. I&rsquo;m waiting for the tutorial for &#8220;Intermediate Developers&rdquo;! One which covers a lot of the extensible features of Orchard, like Advanced and Custom filtering in Admin Views, Organizing Admin Left Navigation, Using Taxonomies is custom filters, etc.&#8221;</p>


<blockquote><p>Samuel Davidson &ndash; a udemy student</p></blockquote>


<p>&ldquo;Your course was clear and crisp.&rdquo;</p>


<blockquote><p>Subhasis Rout &ndash; a udemy student</p></blockquote>


<p>&ldquo;Excellent Course. Thanks for creating this course. Very Helpful.&rdquo;</p>


<blockquote><p>Ram Rathod &ndash; a udemy student</p></blockquote>


<p>&ldquo;Thanks for the course.&rdquo;</p>


<blockquote><p>Harry Johnson &ndash; a udemy student</p></blockquote>


<p>“The course is very good in that it explains the basics very clearly and concisely and even helps to set up Orchard and have it running in a test environment!”</p>


<blockquote><p>Damindra Gunatillake &ndash; a udemy student</p></blockquote>


<p>&ldquo;The course was very instructive and helped me understand some of the basics of Orchard CMS. Thanks for creating the course as well as taking an interest in your students :)&rdquo;</p>


<blockquote><p>Matej Chudo &ndash; a udemy student</p></blockquote>


<p>&ldquo;This course is recommended if you never used Orchad CMS earlier. I first had a look at Orchard several years ago as I was looking for a good blog platform. At that time it wasn&rsquo;t mature enough.</p>


<p>Today Mr. Abhishek Luv proved me otherwise.</p>


<p>I will from today and onwards use Orchard for my Intranet solution.</p>


<p>The course is very well structured and is definitely a very good teaser of Orchard capabilities.&#8221;</p>


<blockquote><p>Peder Thornstrom &ndash; a udemy student</p></blockquote>
