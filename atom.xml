    <id>http://www.abhishekluv.in/blog/2016/01/28/ways-in-which-you-can-contribute-to-open-source-projects</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I love open source projects and contributing to open source projects has helped me in many ways.</p>

<h2>Benefits of contributing to open source projects:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Opportunity to meet new people online</li>
<li>Community owners and contributors will trust you without meeting you in person</li>
<li>Community appreciations</li>
<li>and many more&hellip;</li>
</ul>


<p>Never contributed to any open source project?</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>No problem. Find an open source project in your area of interest and start contributing.</p>

<p>Let me share my contributing experience and how I started contributing to an open source project called &ldquo;Orchard&rdquo;.</p>

<p>BTW.</p>

<p>Orchard CMS is a free, open source, community-focused Content Management System built on the ASP.NET MVC platform.</p>


<p>Orchard is delivered under the .NET Foundation <a href="http://www.dotnetfoundation.org/orchard">http://www.dotnetfoundation.org/orchard</a>. For more info on Orchard visit the official website <a href="http://www.orchardproject.net/">http://www.orchardproject.net/</a>
and for more Orchard CMS tutorials subscribe to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAQxeMbUaKePrVE3wbNZxjg">Orchard Beginner YouTube channel.</a></p>


<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about the ways in which you can contribute to open source projects.</p>

<ul>
<li>Write documentations</li>
<li>Create tutorials</li>
<li>Create premium tutorials</li>
<li>Contribute source code or Help find/fix bugs</li>
<li>Spread the word and your knowledge</li>
<li>Appreciating the community and not be a jerk</li>
<li>Interview other open source contributors and share knowledge</li>
</ul>


<h2>Write documentations</h2>

<p>Most open source projects lack good documentation and this is an opportunity for you as a newbie or an experienced developer to put in some efforts and start writing documentations for your favourite open source project.</p>

<p>Most of the open source documentations are written in .md Markdown so make sure to learn Markdown before starting to contribute/fix documentations.</p>

<p>Community owners and members really appreciate genuine contributors and might give write/push access to the documentation repository.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p><a href="http://docs.orchardproject.net/Contributors">http://docs.orchardproject.net/Contributors</a></p>

<h2>Create tutorials</h2>

<p>After writing some documentation and gaining some experience with an open source project you can move to the next level and start creating video tutorials which will ultimately help new community members and shorten the learning curve.</p>

<p>Creating tutorials and uploading them on YouTube comes with added bonus i.e. <a href="http://orchardbeginner.com/">more traffic to your own blog or website</a> which can bring in some nice exposure for you as a contributor/developer.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>It makes me feel so appreciated when other developers and contributors share my tutorial and course links on Stackoverflow.</p>

<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/11452276">http://stackoverflow.com/a/11452276</a></p>

<h2>Create premium tutorials</h2>

<p>With uploading free tutorials on YouTube you can even start selling premium tutorials and courses via online platforms like Udemy.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>After creating my first Orchard tutorial series I created 2 premium courses and the response I got from the community and subscribers were astonishing. All of my Orchard courses are listed on the official documentation website of Orchard.</p>

<p><a href="http://docs.orchardproject.net/Documentation/Orchard-TV">http://docs.orchardproject.net/Documentation/Orchard-TV</a></p>

<h2>Contribute source code or Help find/fix bugs</h2>

<p>The number one way to help out is find/fix bugs for your favourite open source project. Found a bug fix it or let other community contributors know about it.</p>

<p>Most of the open source projects are hosted on GitHub so make sure to learn Git and GitHub before creating issues/pull requests for your favourite open source project.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>The community owners and members appreciated my contribution with a shout out.</p>

<p><a href="http://docs.orchardproject.net/Documentation/Orchard-1-9.Release-Notes#Contributors">http://docs.orchardproject.net/Documentation/Orchard-1-9.Release-Notes#Contributors</a></p>

<h2>Spread the word and your knowledge</h2>

<p>You can go and tell the world about your favourite open source project. Tweet about it. Blog about it. Just help get the word out and make the project more popular.</p>

<p><a href="http://orchardbeginner.com/">http://orchardbeginner.com/</a></p>

<h2>Appreciating the community and not be a jerk</h2>

<p>Never ever act like a jerk while interacting with the community contributors and members. Never try to take them for granted.</p>

<h2>Interview other open source contributors and share knowledge</h2>

<p>You can even interview other contributors of your favourite open source projects and share the knowledge.</p>

<p>If you have any other ideas on how to contribute, please share them below in the comments.</p>

<p>Stay tuned.</p>

<p>Take care!</p>

    <link href="http://www.abhishekluv.in/blog/2016/01/13/standing-and-sitting-with-pomodoro-technique/"/>
    <updated>2016-01-13T17:31:42+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://www.abhishekluv.in/blog/2016/01/13/standing-and-sitting-with-pomodoro-technique</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Standing and Sitting with Pomodoro Technique.</p>

<p>This week I decided to experiment and make a custom standing desk for myself.</p>




<!-- more -->




<p><em>As I had mentioned in one of my <a href="http://www.abhishekluv.in/blog/2015/12/21/plans-for-year-2016/">previous post</a> that I will be keeping track of every task I do and blog about it online.</em></p>




<p>At this moment the setup looks quite messy with a lot of wires hanging around.</p>




<h2>Things used to setup the standing desk</h2>




<p><em>Only two things.</em></p>




<ul>
<li>A Wooden adjustable study table</li>
<li>Some books to adjust the height of the wooden study table</li>
</ul>




<h2>Cost</h2>




<p>Just 900/- INR i.e. $15</p>




<p><img src="" data-src="http://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/d2dstaticresources/abhishek/Standing+Desk.JPG" title="Abhishek Luv's Custom Standing Desk" alt="&quot;Abhishek Luv's Custom Standing Desk&quot;" /></p>


<p>Why a standing desk? Because too much of sitting is bad.</p>

<h2>What happens if you stand too much?</h2>

<ul>
<li>It can cause leg pain</li>
<li>It can cause back pain</li>
<li>It can make your legs sore</li>
</ul>


<h2>What happens if you sit too much?</h2>

<ul>
<li>It can affect the flow of blood and oxygen in your body</li>
<li>It can become the cause of your obesity</li>
<li>It can cause you headaches, legs, arms and wrist numbness</li>
</ul>


<p>We need to strike a balance between standing, sitting and doing activities like stretching, squatting, doing vital deep diaphragmatic breathing, and drinking plenty of water which can help us lose those fat sitting on our belly.</p>

<p>Ever heard of Pomodoro technique?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a technique where you work with time and not against time by taking short breaks in between while doing your work.</p>

<p>It can help you manage distractions and create a better work/life balance.</p>

<p>Now should we stand or sit while working? It&rsquo;s not a question about standing or sitting. Moving more is probably better than standing or sitting.</p>

<h2>Better solution</h2>

<p>A better solution is to use Pomodoro technique with standing and sitting while working.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Standing for 25mins and Sitting for 5mins</li>
<li>Sitting for 50mins and Standing for 10mins</li>
<li>Note: Don&rsquo;t forget to include squatting and stretching and having plenty of water while you stand or sit</li>
</ul>


<p>The key is to do some activity every day.</p>

<ul>
<li>A walk to and from work</li>
<li>or taking the stairs</li>
</ul>


<p>Stay healthy, Stay fit!</p>

<p>Stay tuned!</p>




<p>Take care!</p>

    <link href="http://www.abhishekluv.in/blog/2016/01/05/things-every-newbie-programmer-should-do/"/>
    <updated>2016-01-05T07:38:27+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://www.abhishekluv.in/blog/2016/01/05/things-every-newbie-programmer-should-do</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Things Every Newbie Programmer Should Know &amp; Do.</p>

<ul>
<li>Keep learning</li>
<li>Start learning from Open source projects</li>
<li>Read code</li>
<li>Do a lot of practice</li>
</ul>


<!-- more -->


<p><em>All of the points mentioned in this blog post are from the book I&rsquo;m currently reading &ldquo;97 Things Every Programmer Should Know&rdquo;.</em></p>

<p><em>As I was reading this book I just thought to share it on my blog for students and newbies who haven&rsquo;t read this book.</em></p>

<h2>Keep Learning</h2>

<p>To play it safe, you need to take responsibility for your own education. Don&rsquo;t try to depend on computer institutes and their fake stale certificates and degrees.</p>

<ul>
<li>Start reading books, blogs, twitter feeds, magazines and websites.</li>
<li>Get hands on by writing some code</li>
<li>Find yourself a mentor</li>
<li>Start fiddling with frameworks and libraries you use</li>
<li>A good way to learn something is to teach or speak about it</li>
<li>Join a local meetup group</li>
<li>Listen to developer podcasts</li>
<li>Learn a new language every year</li>
<li>Learn and understand the language</li>
</ul>


<p>Knowing how something works makes you know how to use it better.</p>

<h2>Start learning from Open source projects</h2>

<p>Getting started with open source is pretty easy.</p>

<ul>
<li>You can start by offering help to fix the documentation of an open source project</li>
<li>Read other people&rsquo;s code. You can learn a lot by reading other people&rsquo;s source code</li>
<li>You can contribute your own code and ideas to the projects</li>
<li>You will meet new like-minded people and become friends with them</li>
<li>Open source contributions can help you to add real-world experience in the technology that actually interests you</li>
<li>You can get community rewards, benefits and access to official project sites and documentation websites.</li>
</ul>


<p>In order to find more open sourced software’s, components and frameworks head over to github.com and search for projects according to your favourite programming language.</p>

<p>Once you have done searching and finding an interested project according to your requirement, next start learning, using and contributing to that project on GitHub.</p>

<p>And if you were not able to find any projects, then build your own project and share it with the world. If you really want to get involved with projects online, you could offer to help out with the documentation or you could start by volunteering to write test code.</p>

<p>Contributing, helping and fixing open source projects and documentation, finding bugs, suggesting fixes and making friends will make you a better programmer than who is not doing open source.</p>

<p>Now go out there and fix some projects and documentations.</p>

<h2>Read code</h2>

<p>Start reading other people&rsquo;s source code. Try to learn from other people&rsquo;s mistakes and get better at coding.</p>

<p>Now from where should you start?</p>

<p>Open source projects&hellip;</p>

<p>Open source projects are full of good examples of how to write brilliant and readable code.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s always better to read some source code instead of a book if you need to improve your programming skills.</p>

<h2>Do a lot of practice</h2>

<p>you need Skills and Techniques to become good at something especially programming and with a lot of practice you can become a skilled programmer.</p>

<p>You need 10,000 hours of practice i.e. 416 days and 16 hours of practice to become an expert.</p>

<p>Practicing does not mean doing what you are good at; it means challenging yourself, doing what you are not good at.</p>

<p>Practicing is about learning, learning that changes you, learning that makes you better at coding and improves your coding skills.</p>

<p><em>All of the points mentioned in this blog post are from the book I&rsquo;m currently reading &ldquo;97 Things Every Programmer Should Know&rdquo;.</em></p>

<p><em>As I was reading this book I just thought to share it on my blog for students and newbies who haven&rsquo;t read this book.</em></p>

<p>Stay tuned!</p>

<p>Take Care!</p>

    <id>http://www.abhishekluv.in/blog/2015/12/21/receiving-email-notifications-for-new-subscribers-with-sendy</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sendy is one of the best Emailer software out there on the web. I love Sendy.</p>

<p>Sendy + Amazon SES = Awesomeness</p>

<p>But sendy doesn&rsquo;t have a feature of receiving email notifications when new subscribers register on our websites.</p>

<p>I have figured out to do it using an email service called &ldquo;Mandrill&rdquo; by sending email to myself using ajax calls.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Mandrill is an email infrastructure service. With the API of Mandrill, we can send email only by JavaScript.</p>

<h2>Steps</h2>

<ol>
<li>Create a new <a href="https://mandrillapp.com/">Mandrill</a> account</li>
<li>Get your Mandrill API Key</li>
<li><a href="https://mandrillapp.com/settings/sending-domains">Verify</a> your Domain Name and Email Address</li>
<li>Add TXT SPF and DKIM records for authentication for your Domain name</li>
<li>Wait for the records to propagate</li>
<li>Use the below given code with your API key to receive email notification after someone registers using the sendy form</li>
</ol>


<h2>Sample Sendy Subscribe Form</h2>

<p>When we create a new list using sendy we get this subscribe form which we can embed on our websites for our users to subscribe.</p>

<p><strong><em>Note : Your form code may differ.</em></strong></p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/abhishekluv/09e0449b0ed91b14a9d7.js"></script>


<h2>jQuery code for receiving email notifications using Mandrill</h2>

<p>The below given code checks all the input boxes and then sends a post request to mandrill with all the form input values using AJAX. Mandrill then replies back by sending  an email to you.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/abhishekluv/6164fa516a8f5ba6644a.js"></script>


<p>In order to receive email notifications for every sendy form you will have to add the above javascript and jquery code for every sendy form and even alter the form IDs and javascript variables.</p>

<p><strong><em>Note : Keep in mind that your API key is visible to anyone, so any malicious user may use your key to send out emails that can eat up your quota.</em></strong></p>

    <link href="http://www.abhishekluv.in/blog/2015/12/19/getting-healthy-fit-and-consistent/"/>
    <updated>2015-12-19T10:31:38+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://www.abhishekluv.in/blog/2015/12/19/getting-healthy-fit-and-consistent</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It is not what we eat but what we digest and assimilate that adds to our health, strength and usefulness. Let&rsquo;s get Healthy, Fit and Consistent.</p>

<p>This year starting from July, I made some changes in the way I manage my health and day-to-day activities.</p>

<ul>
<li>Saying No to few things</li>
<li>Saying Yes to few things</li>
<li>Giving body what it needs</li>
<li>Developing a habit pattern</li>
</ul>


<p>I hope these things can be of some help for you too.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Saying No to few things :</h2>

<ul>
<li>Aerated drinks</li>
<li>Milk (Milk is best taken alone, or let alone)</li>
<li>Tea</li>
<li>Coffee</li>
<li>Burgers</li>
<li>Diet Aerated drinks</li>
<li>Smoking</li>
<li>Alcohol</li>
<li>Meat</li>
<li>Any Non-veg products</li>
</ul>


<h2>Saying Yes to few things :</h2>

<ul>
<li>Water(Depends. 3litres water every day)</li>
<li>Leafy vegetables</li>
<li>Green tea</li>
<li>Dry fruits</li>
<li>Fresh fruits</li>
<li>Jaggery(better than white sugar)</li>
<li>Dates(natural sweet)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Giving body what it needs</h2>

<p>These are some of the things that I have altered in my everyday activity.</p>

<p>Our body’s need these things more than foods :</p>

<ul>
<li>Oxygen : Doing vital diaphragmatic breathing</li>
<li>Water : Having water and more liquid content</li>
<li>Aerobic exercise : Doing exercise using Aerobic power (i.e. my breath)</li>
<li>Breakfast : Starting my day with something live in the morning( Lime or any fruit juice)</li>
<li>Structural support : While sitting on a chair I try not to sit on my thighs. Instead, I sit on my sit bone. Blood and Oxygen circulation should be normal while sitting. If we hunch or sit on our thighs, then our blood and oxygen circulation will not be proper.</li>
<li>Properly combining my food</li>
</ul>


<p><em>It is not what we eat but what we digest and assimilate that adds to our health, strength and usefulness.</em></p>

<h2>Developing a habit pattern</h2>

<p>I have developed my own habit pattern which helps me to stay energetic and in balance the whole day. No backaches, No headaches, No leg numbness, No hands or wrist numbness.</p>

<ul>
<li>4:30am: Get up, having Lime juice with lukewarm water and with very little honey (You can avoid honey if required)</li>
<li>5:00am: Colon cleansing (Potty time and productivity thinking time. Potty time is very imp.)</li>
<li>5:30am to 6:30am: Exercise or 1hour Meditation (by concentrating on the breath or listening to Sanskrit mantras. With empty/half empty stomach)</li>
<li>7:00am : Breaking the fast with an Oat Meal(Oats, Dry fruits, little jaggery)</li>
<li>7:30am : Starting my work</li>
<li>10:30am : Working and Having some fresh raw vegetables/fruits like(carrots, cucumber, apples, banana or others)</li>
<li>12:00pm : Working and Having a glass of Green tea with Hot water, Lemon and very little honey</li>
<li>2:00pm : Lunch time(dal, little rice, 3 roti’s, vegetables, vegetables with high fibre content)</li>
<li>2:30pm : Back to my work</li>
<li>5:00pm : Working and Having a glass of Green tea with Hot water(No lemon or honey)</li>
<li>6:30pm to 7:30pm : 1hour Walking(<a href="#fitbit">Minimum 10,000 steps</a>. With empty/half empty stomach.)</li>
<li>8:00pm: Having one Mosambi (Orange-Navel) fruit</li>
<li>dinner before 9:00pm: Dinner time (dal, no rice, 2 roti’s, vegetables, and vegetables with high fibre content)</li>
<li>10:00pm: time for bed.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Fitbit app</h2>

<p>I use the Fitbit app with Motion Data to count the number of steps I have completed while walking.</p>

<p><em>I&rsquo;m using the Fitbit app with my Microsoft 640 XL Windows Phone</em></p>

<p><img src="" data-src="https://dajgbgqiuncfc.cloudfront.net/abhishek/fitbit+for+windowsphone.jpg" alt="Using Fitbit app with Motion Data" id="fitbit"/></p>

<p>I hope these things can be of some help for you too.</p>

<p>Stay healthy, Stay fit and Stay consistent.</p>

Vairagya samrajyadha poojanabhyam, namo nama sri guru padukhabyam., 1</p>
<p>Salutations and Salutations to the sandals of my Guru,
Which is a boat, which helps me,cross the endless ocean of life,

And by worship of which, I attain the dominion of renunciation</p></blockquote>

Salutations and Salutations to the sandals of my Guru,</p>
<p>Which is the ocean of knowledge, resembling the full moon,
Which is the water, which puts out the fire of misfortunes,
And which removes distresses of those who prostrate before it.</p></blockquote>

<p>Which make those who prostrate before it,
Possessors of great wealth, even if they are very poor,,
And which makes even dumb people in to great orators.</p></blockquote>

Which shine like gems on the crown of a king,
Which shine like a maid in the crocodile infested stream,
And which make the devotees attain the status of a king.</p></blockquote>

<p>7</p>


<blockquote><p>Shamadhi shatka pradha vaibhavabhyam,Samadhi dhana vratha deeksithabhyam,

Which gives the students ,the ability to go in to eternal trance,
And which helps to get perennial devotion to the feet of Vishnu.</p></blockquote>

Swanthachad bhava pradha poojanabhyam, namo nama sri guru padukhabyam., 8</p>
<p>Salutations and Salutations to the sandals of my Guru
Which bestows all desires of the serving disciples,
Who are ever involved in carrying the burden of service
And which helps the aspirants to the state of realization.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Kaamadhi sarpa vraja garudabhyam, viveka vairagya nidhi pradhabhyam,
Bhodha pradhabhyam drutha mokshathabhyam, namo nama sri guru padukhabyam., 9</p>
<p>Salutations and Salutations to the sandals of my Guru
Which is the Garuda,which drives away the serpent of passion,
Which provides one, with the treasure of wisdom and renunciation,
Which blesses one,with enlightened knowledge,
And blesses the aspirant with speedy salvation.</p></blockquote>
